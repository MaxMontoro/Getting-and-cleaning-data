Transformations

- Merged test data with training data (data, labels and subject) using rbind

- Combined all the data into one dataframe with cbind

Functions used:

read.table - for reading from file

write.table - for writing to file

rbind - for appending rows

cbind - for appending columns

grep - for searching for strings 

aggregate - for calculating means for each subject and each activity; I found this to be a very helpful function
