## Getting and cleaning data
### Course of the John Hopkins University

The run_analysis.R script is for the course project for "Getting and cleaning data".

It takes the data generated by the Samsung smartphones and merges the different files into one:
it joins test and training data, assigns subject IDs and labels to the activities.
According to the course requirements, it only takes into account the features of the measurements
that include mean or standard deviation values. Therefore, a cleaning step was necessarry: from 561 variables, 66 remained. 
The script also calculates the mean of each variable for each subject and each activity, as required by the project description.
